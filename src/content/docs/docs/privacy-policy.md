AzuraCast ("us", "we", or "our") operates the https://azuracast.com/ website (the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible from https://www.azuracast.com/

## Information Collection And Use

We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.

### Data Collected via the AzuraCast Central Service

Radio stations using the self-hosted AzuraCast software may connect to the AzuraCast Central service (central.azuracast.com) in order to submit details about their installation for the purpose of checking for updates, retrieving new announcements, or optionally informing the AzuraCast developers about how their software is being used on the Web.

By default, all AzuraCast installations will send only the following limited subset of information to the AzuraCast Central server:

- Randomized AzuraCast instance ID
- SHA hash of the current version of AzuraCast that is running
- The platform that the AzuraCast instance is running from (Docker or Bare-metal)
- The public IP address of the self-hosted AzuraCast instance

This information is collected and stored on AzuraCast servers for the sole purposes of tracking the number of installations across the Web using a specific version and platform of the software, and informing station operators of any important updates or announcements.

This data is kept exclusively on AzuraCast's servers and is not made available to any third party.

In the future, AzuraCast may invite installation operators to voluntarily submit additional data about their installations for the purposes of understanding how AzuraCast is used by operators, submission of feedback to core developers, or for providing remote support. These services will all be offered on an opt-in basis only. As these services are introduced, this Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect the data collected by each individual service.
