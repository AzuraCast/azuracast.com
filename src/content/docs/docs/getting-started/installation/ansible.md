While our software is primarily deployed via Docker, there is an alternative installation method that allows you to install the software directly onto a host computer without Docker. We call this method the **Ansible installer** because it uses the Ansible deployment orchestration tool under the hood.

**This installation method is no longer supported by AzuraCast.**

A community-maintained repository containing our Ansible installation files is maintained on GitHub. Follow the readme on the project's homepage for instructions on how to install AzuraCast via Ansible:
