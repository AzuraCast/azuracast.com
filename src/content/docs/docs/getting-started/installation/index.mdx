### üêã Docker (Recommended)

**Docker installation now supports ARM64 devices as well (i.e. newer Raspbery Pi devices, and ARM64-based cloud hosts), so you can follow these same installation steps.**

For a majority of users, our Docker installation method is the preferred way of installing and using AzuraCast. Click the link below for Docker installation instructions.
