**You must follow [troubleshooting steps](/docs/help/troubleshooting) prior to filing an issue on GitHub.**

In our issue template, we ask for [logs](/docs/help/logs) and other details that are part of the troubleshooting steps, and supplying these greatly helps us resolve issues.

Support for AzuraCast is only provided for the current `Stable` and up to date `Rolling-Release` versions. Make sure to update your installation before reporting an issue. We regularly publish updates that resolve issues and add new features.
:::

If your issue isn't in our known issues or common solutions, check out our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AzuraCast/AzuraCast/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) board. We use GitHub to track the status of errors, bug reports and general questions.

If there's already an open GitHub issue for the specific issue you're having, you can follow that issue for updates. If not, you can create a new issue from the same page.

When creating a new issue, you'll be presented with a template of questions to answer to help our team provide quick and accurate support. 

**Please make sure to answer these questions and provide as much detail as possible!**

Please include the following:

- Any steps that you have already attempted
- Any errors you may have encountered
- A full step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the issue
- Screenshots if applicable
- Relevant [logs (click here for instructions on how to get them)](/docs/help/logs)
