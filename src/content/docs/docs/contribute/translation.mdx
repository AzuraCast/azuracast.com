Do you speak both English and another language? You can help us in a big way by helping translate AzuraCast!

AzuraCast is used around the world, and we want our web application to be accessible to users who aren't familiar with English, our primary language.

Thanks to the help of our friends at CrowdIn, translating the strings used in our application is easy! Just visit our translation page and create an account, and you can start submitting translations. CrowdIn also provides suggested translations in case you are unsure of certain words or phrases.

We do our best to incorporate translation changes as frequently as possible, but sometimes new updates are delayed. If you have completed a significant translation project, please feel free to give us a gentle reminder by creating a Github issue. Once the translations have been updated, we will close the issue to let you know.
