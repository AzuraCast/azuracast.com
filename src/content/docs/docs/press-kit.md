AzuraCast welcomes any related code projects, hosting partners, media agencies and freelance journalists to utilize our branding as needed to refer to our software.

This page will provide our images, audio and files that you may wish to include. 

## About Us

AzuraCast is a free and open-source, self-hosted, all-in-one web radio management suite. We like to refer to it as a "web radio station in a box", as it includes the full stack of open-source software needed to start up a new radio station, broadcast to listeners and manage everything via a web interface.

AzuraCast's history dates back to late 2012 in the form of our predecessor project [Ponyville Live](https://github.com/slvreagle23/ponyville-live). In spring 2016, the project was rebuilt as the self-hosted web radio management suite it is today. Our branding and marketing still heavily features our unicorn mascot (designed by [Tyson-Tan](https://tysontan.com/)) as a tribute to our fandom roots.

AzuraCast was created by [Buster "Silver Eagle" Neece](https://github.com/slvreagle23), who remains the project's lead developer. He is supported by a second developer and a community moderator.

Today, AzuraCast powers thousands of installations and continues to be actively maintained on a daily basis.

- Promotional Audio Files along with a License Certificate

### Press Kit Guidelines

As a courtesy, we ask that the following rules be applied:

- Do not modify and/or alter the AzuraCast Logo, Mascot (Azura Ruisselante), or our Hexagon Logo
- Do not modify the sound files we provide in any shape or form

AzuraCast is licensed under the Apache 2.0 software license, which expressly protects its name and branding while allowing the source code to be fully free and open. This means that you are free to use our branding to refer to AzuraCast itself (specifically, the version we maintain and distribute), but you are not permitted to call your own fork or code AzuraCast,  or use our branding as your company's own logo when offering services related to AzuraCast, such as managed hosting.
