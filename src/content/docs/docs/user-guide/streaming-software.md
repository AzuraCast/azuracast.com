:::caution
If you are using a reverse proxy service (like CloudFlare) in front of your installation, be aware that these services often prevent direct connections to the ports that broadcasters connect to. You should instruct your streamers to use the direct IP address of your server instead.

## Mixxx

**Linux, MacOS, Windows; Free and Open-Source**

[Mixxx](https://www.mixxx.org) is free and open-source DJ software that also supports live broadcasting via IceCast and ShoutCast servers.

Live broadcasting settings can be found in the preferences menu (`Options` -> `Preferences`). It is recommended to use "Icecast 2" mode when broadcasting to AzuraCast. Out of the box, Mixxx does not include the LAME MP3 encoder (for licensing reasons), but it is not needed when connecting to AzuraCast; just set your broadcast format to 'Ogg Vorbis' and LiquidSoap will transcode the broadcast into the correct output format.

## BUTT

**Linux, MacOS, Windows; Free and Open-Source**

Cross-platform and available for free at [https://sourceforge.net/projects/butt/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/butt/). Streaming via both IceCast mode and ShoutCast mode are available.

### IceCast Mode

Use the exact information specified on the Streamer/DJ page's right sidebar. "Address" is "Server" and "Icecast mountpoint" is "Mount Name".

![BUTT Sample IceCast configuration](../images/streaming-software/butt_icecast.png)

### ShoutCast Mode

Use the given port specified in the "ShoutCast v1 Clients" section. Since ShoutCast v1 does not let you specify a username, specify your password as `dj_username:dj_password` (the username and password for the DJ separated by a colon).

![BUTT Sample ShoutCast configuration](../images/streaming-software/butt_shoutcast.png)

## SAM Cast

**Windows; Proprietary, Commercial**

[SAM Cast](https://spacial.com/sam-cast/) is commercial software sold by Spacial. It is compatible with AzuraCast by using the MP3 encoder and the "IceCast 2" server connection settings.

### Broadcasting Steps

From the main SAM Cast window, click "Encoders" at the bottom left.

![](../images/streaming-software/samcast_1.png)

In the Encoders window that pops up, click the plus sign button on the toolbar to add a new encoder.

![](../images/streaming-software/samcast_2.png)

You will be asked to select an encoder. It is recommended to select `MP3 (LAME_ENC)`, because this allows for the easiest constant bit rate (CBR) streaming, which causes the fewest issues when broadcasting.

Click "OK" at the bottom to continue to encoder details.

![](../images/streaming-software/samcast_3.png)

On the first tab of the encoder details, change your bitrate from the default 64kbps to your desired bitrate. This should likely match the highest bitrate that you broadcast out to your listeners. By default, it should at least be 128kbps.

![](../images/streaming-software/samcast_4.png)

Click the "Server Details" tab. On the "Server Type" selector, choose "IceCast", then choose "IceCast 2" in the secondary selector.

You can now populate the "Server Details" section with the connection information supplied to you via AzuraCast's "Streamers/DJs" page. You will want to use the connection information for "IceCast Clients", the first section on the page.

![](../images/streaming-software/samcast_5.png)

Click OK to return to the main Encoders pane, where you will now see a new encoder with "Idle" status.

Select the encoder, then click the play-button icon in the toolbar to begin broadcasting.

## RadioBOSS

**Windows; Proprietary, Commercial**

[RadioBOSS](https://www.djsoft.net/) is a commercial software sold by IP Kuzmitski D.V. at DJSoft.net.

Streaming via both IceCast mode and ShoutCast mode are available.

The Live broadcasting feature is possible in their Standard and Advanced edition (not in the Express edition).

Note that for ease of use we use the `Configuration Wizard`, you can also enter all connection details manually.

### Instructions

1. In the top menu bar, select `Settings` -> `Options`

2. In the `Settings` window, select `Broadcast` on the left

3. To add a new encoder, click the `+` button

  ![RadioBOSS Settings: Broadcast menu](../images/streaming-software/radioboss_1.jpg)

4. The Encoder-window will open, next click the button called `Configuration Wizard`.

  ![RadioBOSS Encoder window](../images/streaming-software/radioboss_2.jpg)

Follow the instructions for the server type you have set up your Azuracast station with:

### Icecast

- Select `Icecast 1 & 2` and click `Next >`

![RadioBOSS Encoder Configuration Wizard IceCast](../images/streaming-software/radioboss_3.jpg)

- Take over the corresponding credentials you can find in Azuracast:

![RadioBOSS Encoder Configuration Wizard IceCast Azuracast Example settings](../images/streaming-software/radioboss_4.jpg)

- Click `Finish`

### SHOUTcast

The following settings are recommended for both ShoutCast v1 as v2 (DNAS 2)

Note 1: Use the given port specified in the "ShoutCast v1 Clients" section.

Note 2: Be sure to select `v1`, as v2 will append the Stream ID (SID), which won't work.

- Select `SHOUTcast v1` and click `Next >`

![RadioBOSS Encoder Configuration Wizard SHOUTcast](../images/streaming-software/radioboss_5.jpg)

- Take over the corresponding credentials you can find in Azuracast (see notes above):

![RadioBOSS Encoder Configuration Wizard SHOUTcast Azuracast Example settings](../images/streaming-software/radioboss_6.jpg)

- Click `Finish`

6. Finish by changing the rest of the settings by preference:

  - Connection
    - Sample Rate
    - Encoder
    - Bitrate
    - Channels

  - Station info

    If needed, here you can override the info that can be found in the main `Settings` (From step 1), under `Broadcasting` -> `Metadata`

7. Then finally click `OK` to save the Encoder.

8. In the Settings window, check the checkboxes for all encoders that you want to use.
Remember to turn on the option `Broadcasting enabled` on top.

On succesful connection, the log report in the bottom-left corner of RadioBOSS will show the following message: "Connected to server! (Output N)". This means that listeners can now connect to the streaming server (either IceCast or ShoutCast).

If the logs show "[E40] Cannot start broadcast" in red, go over the above steps.

More information can be found in the RadioBOSS Help System. Press `Ctrl+F1` inside the RadioBOSS application, or in the top menu bar go to `Help` -> `Contents`.

The following articles in there are helpful:
- `Operation` -> `Broadcasting Internet radio`
- `Options` -> `Broadcast`
- `Options` -> `Broadcast` -> `Metadata`

# PlayIt Live
