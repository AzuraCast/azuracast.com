# Playlists

Playlists are collections of media that are played by the AutoDJ according to certain rules. For example, you can have one or more playlists that are considered "General Rotation" and will play throughout the day, or playlists that only play every few songs, or every few minutes.

Any playlists types can also be scheduled to play in one or more specific time blocks, or to play between a certain date range.

## Advanced Playlists

There is one special type of playlist that allows you to fully customize your playlist's rules in the AutoDJ, the Advanced Playlist.
