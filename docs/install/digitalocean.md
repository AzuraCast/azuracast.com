![](/img/DO_Logo_Horizontal_Blue.png)

We've partnered with our friends at [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/21612b90440f) to create a 1-Click installer that sets up and configures a droplet with AzuraCast's recommended Docker installation configured and ready to go.

Learn more about the 1-Click installer and create a droplet today [on the DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/azuracast).
